\section{Getting started.}

Once the system has been installed (see section \ref{install}) you can launch 
\AFD\ by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
% phox
>phox> 
\end{verbatim}

Note: The system prints the prompt {\tt >phox>} and is waiting for your
commands. From now, all the examples will follow the following convention: all
the characters following the prompt {\tt >phox>} (till the next dot) are
characters you have to type, and the remaining characters are the answers of
the system.
