PhoX is an implementation of Higher Order Logic

You will find in the file "INSTALL" the instruction to install PhoX on
an Unix machine. If you are familiar with OCaml, it should not be
difficult to get it work on any machine which can run OCaml.

In the directory "./doc" you will find a documentation for this
software (This is a draft):
  - The files doc.pdf is the documentation of the system
  - The files libdoc.pdf are preliminary TeX version
  of the documentation of all libraries
Theses files are installed in the directory DOCDIR specified in
the config files (see INSTALL)

The folders tutorial/french and tutorial/english contain tutorial
