PhoX is an implementation of Higher Order Logic

The current version is EXPERIMENTAL and does not feature program 
extraction. It's only a proof editor for second order logic.

However, I will be grateful if you try it, reports bugs and make any
suggestions which might improve future releases.

You will find in the file "INSTALL" the instruction to install PhoX on
an Unix machine. If you are familiar with OCaml, it should not be
difficult to get it work on any machine which can run OCaml.

In the directory "./doc" you will find a documentation for this
software (This is a draft):
  - The files doc.dvi and doc.ps is the documentation of the system
  - The files xxx.aft is the documentation of the library xxx
  - The files libdoc.dvi and libdoc.ps are preliminary TeX version
  of the documentation of all libraries
Theses files are installed in the directory DOCDIR specified in
the config files (see INSTALL)

The folders tutorial/french and tutorial/english contain tutorial

Look at www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/~raffalli/phox.html for more
information.
