TO INSTALL the "PhoX Logic System" proceed as follow:

1) Get and install objective-caml version 3.0* (at least 3.08) You get
   get it by ftp:
	
		site = ftp.inria.fr
		dir = pub/lang/caml-light
		file = ocaml-3.0.tar.gz

   Use gnu make (can be gmake on  BSD systems).
		
2) Get and install the latest version of PhoX by 
ftp :

                site = www.lama.univ-savoie.fr 
                       or
                site = ftp.logique.jussieu.fr 
                dir  = pub/distrib/phox/current/ 
                file = phox-0.xxbx.tar.gz

3) Uncompress it and detar it (using {\tt gunzip phox-0.xxbx.tar.gz; tar xvf
  phox-0.xxbx.tar})

4) Move to the directory phox-0.xxbx which has just been created.
     
5) Edit the file "./config", to suit you need. 

6) Type "make"
 
7) Type "make install"

8) If you want the program to look for its libraries in more than one
  directory, you can set the {\tt PHOXPATH} variable, for instance like
  this (with csh):

setenv PHOXPATH /usr/local/lib/phox/lib:$USERS/phox/examples

9) You are strongly encouraged to use the emacs interface to PhoX.
To install an emacs-mode, use Proof-General (release 3.3 or greatest)
from:

http://www.proofgeneral.org/~proofgen

Proof-General works better with xemacs, but pre-releases 3.4 works
reasonably well with gnu-emacs 21.
